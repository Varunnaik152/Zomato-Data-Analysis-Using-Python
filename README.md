### Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

Here we present an interactive data visualization application that allows us to analyze restaurant data from the Zomato website. With Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tkinter, it creates a graphical user interface (GUI) to help users exploring different aspects the dataset through different plots.

## Features

- Quantity of restaurants of various type can be visualized
- What rating distribution do you see? What can be inferred from that?
Instead, look at ratings based on online order availability.
- Analyze cost distribution
- Find a heatmap of orders by online orders for the restaurant types
- Visualize plot of votes by restaurant type
- Top 5 and the bottom 5 restaurants by rating.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
  
That usually comes with Python installations and allows your application to be executed within the Tkinter framework.

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

# bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
  (As a starting point to explore data science, we can execute the above command and will install the pandas, numpy, and matplotlib along with matplotlib).
